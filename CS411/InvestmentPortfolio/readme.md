## Project Description
```
We are going to build a website to analyze and compare performance of different mutual funds, pension funds, 
and private equity firms like Berkshire Hathaway. Our landing page will consist of the daily percentage 
increase or decrease of different finance and investment firms. The user can click on various companies and 
check each respective companies’ portfolios.  The user can then learn about the component stocks and weights
and the performance of all the stocks and analysis will be displayed and sourced from Yahoo finance or the 
companies’ websites. The site visitor can also complete an investment tolerance questionnaire from 
vanguard.com and the website can make appropriate recommendations based on the user’s preferences.
